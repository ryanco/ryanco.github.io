title: Trying Out Sketchnoting

A few weeks ago I stumbled upon [Mike Rhode](https://twitter.com/rohdesign) and his book [The Sketchnote Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/The-Sketchnote-Handbook-Video-Edition/dp/0321885112/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1384137160&sr=8-1&keywords=the+sketchnote+handbook). I've always liked to draw and I often find myself doodling in meetings or when I'm thinking about something. Sketchnoting seemed like an interesting idea, so I picked up the book and started learning. I decided that it would be interesting to try out sketchnoting on a book I was reading. I've been looking for a way to capture the big ideas from books I'm reading and this seemed like a good fit. 

Here are my sketchnotes from [Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software] (http://www.amazon.com/Release-Production-Ready-Software-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0978739213/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1382909212&sr=1-1&keywords=release+it):
