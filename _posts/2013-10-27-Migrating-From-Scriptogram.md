title: Migrating From Scriptogram

I started up a blog this summer upon running across Scriptogram when shopping around after Posterous got nuked. I liked everything about Scriptogram. I keep my content, it was easy to get going, and it was free. Overall, I still really like Scriptogram but a few things were frustrating me. The first was that I could never get images to work. I tried on two non-consecutive occasions to get scriptogram to serve content from my public dropbox folder and it wouldn't work. In googling for an answer, I found Scriptogram seemed to not be very popular. That itself isn't a big deal, but when you can't find help it's frustrating. The second issue was less of an impediment but more concern. Scriptogram was getting slower and slower. It was taking a long time to synch my content between Scriptogram and my dropbox and it was also taking longer and longer to load my published content. Finally, I was concerned that something was going to change from either a cost perspective or a functionality perspective. When I started using Scriptogram it was a beta, I think it's out now, but I assumed something was going to change around them trying to monetize it. Nothing has changed yet, but I'm wondering if it has a future or not.
