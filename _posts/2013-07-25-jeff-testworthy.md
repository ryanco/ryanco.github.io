[John](https://johngrekso.wordpress.com/) and I were talking yesterday about creating a persona to express some of our thoughts on unit testing. 

As such, Jeff Testworthy was born:

* If you find more bugs in the process of verifying your emergency bug release...you might need more automated testing.
- - -
* If it takes you more than two minutes to identify a bug as a "known bug"...you need pay down your tech debt.
- - -
* If you have "known bugs"...fix them.
- - -
* If need to run a bunch of manual regression tests in order to close out work...you might need automated testing.
- - -
* If your test is dependent on someone else's test working right to pass...you might be doing it wrong.
