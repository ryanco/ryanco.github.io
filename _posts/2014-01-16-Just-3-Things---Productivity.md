title: Just 3 Things - Productivity

For me, productivity and motivation are very interrelated. Being productive generates a positive feedback loop that yields motivation to be...wait for it...more productive. I talked a little in my [previous post] ({{site.url}}/2014/01/03/Personal-Retros.html) about how doing small personal retros more often helps me see minor changes more readily. I also use a simple task management scheme I call "Just 3 Things" to track what I need to get done.

My day in the office typically starts around 8am. I usually get coffee and have a few conversations before my first daily meeting at 8:30am. I typically have 5-15 minutes before that meeting starts. During that time, I make a list of 3 things I want to get done that day. I try to size them to what I would consider a "medium" sized task. It's something that will probably take me more than a few minutes but not longer than half a day. As I get stuff done I cross it off the list. If I get all three done, I'll add something new. If I don't get something done, I carry it to the next day or move it to the backlog lists.

In addition to 3 things, I keep two backlog lists. These lists contain all of the outstanding things I need to do and I the high level things my team needs to do that might fall outside our Scrum backlog. I use these two backlogs when making my 3 things list everyday. I also review these lists everyday for accuracy. If a new "thing" comes in for me or the team I add it to the appropriate backlog.

###Rooted in GTD
My little system is mostly rooted in [GTD]("http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd"). I like GTD and I've tried to do it several times. Where I get stuck is I spend more time on the process and trying to get it right than actually getting stuff done. I use many of the concepts:
 
* Having a trusted place to keep all your stuff. 
* Capture everything.
* Reviewing the lists often.
* Keeping track of the big picture.

I mostly just wanted something simple and made me feel like I was making progress. Sometimes, with GTD, I felt like I was always just treading water. Just 3 Things lets me see my productivity very easily. 

###Trees and Forest
I really dislike the feeling of a day where it seems like I got nothing done. As a senior developer, I get pulled into a lot of meetings. While it is possible for meetings to get things done, it's rare to have a day full of meetings that feels truly productive. I started doing "Just 3 Things" with small tasks as a way to feel productive even if I was in meetings all day. I've found that by planning in the morning before all the meetings start, I know what the appropriate loading for the day is. If I have a very heavy meeting day, I'll make the "things" small. If I have a light meeting day, then I'll pick bigger "things" or scope my "things" bigger. What I like is that system gives me a view in both some tactical and strategic progress.

###Analog
I've tried both electronic and paper solutions for GTD and Just 3 Things. I've found paper as the most productive. It's much easier in meetings to jot something down in a notebook and not look like a knob who is playing with your phone or computer. I've also found the list sticks with me a little better if I write it down.
