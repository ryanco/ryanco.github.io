I had a few book reviews in a Google Doc from books I read mostly last year. I thought I would post them here:

[Customers For Life](http://www.amazon.com/Customers-Life-One-Time-Lifetime-Customer/dp/0385504454/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1385346991&sr=1-1&keywords=customers+for+life) by Carl Sewell and Paul Brown

####Summary:
The book covers the gambit of running a “luxury class” business and how to be successful throughout. It has some Lean/Agile themes like continuous improvement and continually trying new things. It covers some aspects like measuring process capability and root cause analysis. 

####Like:

* Taking care of your employees is important as they take care of your customers.
* Don’t be afraid to try new things on a small scale and correct course if they don’t work out.
* Image/Care throughout the business is important. 
* Transparency around people who perform well.
* Create systems that create shared positive outcomes across departments. He gives the example of the new car sales manager wanting high values on trade-ins and use car sales manager wanting low values on trade-ins.
* Leadership is in example. You can’t expect honesty from employees if the leadership is shady.
* Pick people based on fit and try them out. Strive to get the best people.
* Pay for performance.

####Dislike:
* Expectations that employees shouldn't take all vacation and should work excessive hours.
* Author claims Wal-mart has excellent customer service, but Sears has terrible customer service. Maybe Wal-mart is different in Texas
* The author clings to the fact that his was the first dealership to give a free loaner car to EVERY customer, but then later on he says that wasn’t cost effective for his GMC customers so he stopped. 
* The book continually is aimed that “top-tier” customers and how to provide them service rather than just everyday customers. It doesn’t translate very well when your customers have very little money to spend.
* I don’t think the book directly or adequately deals with it’s subtitle “How to turn that one-time buyer into a lifetime customer.” It gives a lot of hints at providing service, but it doesn’t talk much about how you take that first sale or service appointment and turn it into a lasting relationship. That doesn’t really matter to be, but it surprised me.
